    <p>With a sky high Attack stat, high-Base Power moves, and a fantastic ability in Water Bubble, Araquanid functions as an excellent wallbreaker with the capability to heavily damage its foes while forcing switches. Water Bubble-boosted Liquidation hits most of the metagame hard, scoring OHKOs on the likes of Vibrava as well as 2HKOs on Pokemon like Skarmory and Koraidon outside of sun. Tera Water further compounds its damage output, allowing it to 2HKO even bulky Water-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex and Alomomola. Bug-type STAB moves allow Araquanid to handle the Grass-types that hope to switch into Liquidation. Leech Life provides Araquanid with recovery, something it crucially requires as it is vulnerable to chip damage from entry hazards and poison. Lunge and Skitter Smack are alternative options that reduce the offensive capability of opposing physical and special attackers respectively. The final two moveslots can be customized to fit Araquanid’s needs. Trailblaze allows Araquanid to catch Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon or Quagsire on the switch and boost its own Speed, while Poison Jab allows Araquanid to further nail Fairy-types and spread poison. Body Slam is a decent option for coverage, and it also allows Araquanid to further cripple its foes by paralyzing them. Araquanid can take advantage of the switches it forces to run Sticky Web to slow its foes down or Reflect to further weaken any incoming physical Attacks. Finally, Endeavor is an option that Araquanid can utilise when it is low on health to further weaken its foes, allowing its teammates to finish them off.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Physical attackers such as Vibrava and Zacian synergize well with Araquanid, as they can work together to overwhelm shared checks in physically defensive Pokemon, such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Alomomola. Araquanid also heavily appreciates rain setters such as Pelipper, which can clear Koraidon’s sun and replace it with rain to further boost Araquanid’s Liquidation. Choice Band Araquanid is especially vulnerable to entry hazards due to it having to forgo Heavy-Duty Boots; for this reason, hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and Galarian Weezing are excellent teammates for it. Finally, Alomomola can keep Araquanid healthy by Wish passing to it.</p>
